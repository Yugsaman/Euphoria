When I first saw you, it wasn‚Äôt just with my eyes. It was as if the world itself paused, and in that stillness, something sacred awakened within me. It was a moment that couldn‚Äôt be explained, a silent connection that I had long since abandoned believing in. But when I saw you, I felt something real, something deep.
You stood there, dressed in white, and in that instant, everything else seemed to disappear. It wasn‚Äôt just the dress, but the way it unveiled, your quiet grace.
I knew, in that moment, that whatever I truly desire is not destined to remain. I‚Äôve always carried the belief that whatever touches the soul must eventually fade. Yet, still, I stepped forward not with hope, but with curiosity. And almost instantly, I felt the unspoken truth that we would not walk this life together. Still, I could not look away.
It is strange, you know? How you cause me such immense pain, yet, somehow, your mere presence has the power to soothe it. I don‚Äôt fully understand this paradox, but it‚Äôs real, and it lingers with me. Every morning, you are the first thought that comes to my mind, when I experience moments of clarity, I see you not as a memory, but as something alive, something present.

I know we cannot be together here, bound by the limits of this world, but in the realm of the Eternal, where there is no separation, I‚Äôve asked for you. I‚Äôve imagined us there, side by side, heads bowed before Allah, as two of one soul reunited.
You may never know the depth of what I carry for you. I bear my responsibilities with respect, towards my family. But love... love is something different. It‚Äôs not duty. It‚Äôs not comfort. It‚Äôs the quiet willingness to lose yourself in someone else‚Äôs presence, without fear.In this life, there are but a few I would sacrifice everything for‚Äîmy Sheikh, my father, my Abbu Jee... and you..
In the chaos of it all, I imagine you beside me, bringing a sense of calm and peace only you hold.. I don‚Äôt speak easily to others, but to you, in silence, I reveal everything. I imagine a place, beyond the impurities of this world, where we speak not as strangers but as souls, bound by a love unspoken yet understood.
No lifetime could ever be enough to fully express this love. Even a thousand days shared would not reveal the quiet peace I imagine beside you.

But let me say this: after meeting you, I realized how perfect you are in my eyes. Despite our few conversations, the light jokes, the serious talks, I remember them all. I remember you saying your goal wasn‚Äôt clear, but you were determined not to rely on others.You also once shared that instead of stressing over choices, you let others pick what you like, trusting them to know your preferences without burdening yourself, I realized that day that it wasn‚Äôt about dependence, but about trust, deep and rock solid.
I remember that day you wore the yellow dress. It looked so beautiful on you that I couldn‚Äôt tear my eyes away. Your reaction was so sweet,shy and confused, all at once. It made my whole week. There was something in the way you carried yourself that drew me in something deeper.I can‚Äôt help but smile when I think of it, even now. 

I remember that moment when I spoke, and you just listened, if I could ask Allah for you in the afterlife, You replied, ‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù and walked away, When returned, your eyes were swollen, but you smiled, as if nothing had happened. In that brief, vulnerable moment, I caught a glimpse of your grace and depth yet there was no answer.,Still i wait, wondering ..
I remember watching you sleep, so peaceful, so calm. Maybe it was the stillness, or the way your messy hair fell across your face. That gentle mess still catches me every time, you seemed so effortlessly beautiful. It brought me a sense of calm I can‚Äôt explain. You used to call me a creeper for it, I still laugh that little did she know how much i adore her. I remember sitting next to you, playing with your hair while you slept, waiting for you to wake, then teasing you with the smell of Vicks right by your nose. Your reactions, always the cutest, always the funniest.

When you came to Bahrain, I may have seemed distant but I was genuinely excited.Things is, I mentioned your name without hesitation when asked about my ideal woman. But hearing later that your presence around me would be uncomfortable possibly even unsafe for you ? shattered me in ways I can‚Äôt explain.
I would never compare myself to anyone‚Äôs father, but one thing I know for sure, with me, you wil always be safe. I hold you close in every way I can. It gos against every part of me to even imagine. hurting you ?! üôÉ
I remembered telling you that everything about you, I Loved. and to be honest, No matter how hard I tried, I couldn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs like a force of nature, something beyond my control. I just wanted you to know that there is someone out there who loves you without expectation, without return, without condition.

Even if you never know the full depth of this love, know this: you are in my prayers, and in my heart.
