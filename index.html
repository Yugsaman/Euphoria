•••••••••••

When I first saw you, it was not with the eyes alone.
There was something in that moment, something sacred. Though I had long abandoned the idea of such connections believing them to be illusions, distractions of the heart in that instant, I felt something awaken within me, something wordless and real.
You stood there, dressed white, as though the world paused just to let you pass untouched. The dress did not make you fascinating rather, it revealed your aura. A stillness I craved.
I knew then that whatever I actually deeply desire is not destined to remain with me. Such is the case I’ve known since youth. That whatever touches the soul must pass like a dream.
I stepped forward, not with hope, but with curiosity. Yet almost at once, I recognized the silent decree that we would not walk together under the sun of this world.
Still, I could not look away.
Strange it is you cause me pain, and yet your very presence soothes it. I do not understand this paradox, only that it is real.
Each morning,
