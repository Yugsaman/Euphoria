    When I first saw you, it was not with the eyes alone.
    There was something in that moment, something sacred. Though I had long abandoned the idea of such connections believing them to be illusions, distractions of the heart in that instant, I felt something awaken within me, something wordless and real.
    You stood there, dressed white, as though the world paused just to let you pass untouched. The dress did not make you fascinating rather, it revealed your aura. A stillness I craved.
    I knew then that whatever I actually deeply desire is not destined to remain with me. Such is the case I‚Äôve known since youth. that whatever touches the soul must pass like a dream.
    I stepped forward, not with hope, but with curiosity. Yet almost at once, I recognized the silent decree that we would not walk together under the sun of this world.
    Still, I could not look away.
    Strange it is you cause me pain, and yet your very presence soothes it. I do not understand this paradox, only that it is real.
    Each morning, I rise, yours is the first thought that drifts across.
    In every moment of truth when life becomes more than noise and movement, you appear not as a memory but as a presence. 
    I know we cannot be together here. With these rules and illusions. But in the realm of the Eternal where there is no separation, I have asked for you. I have seen us there, side by side, heads bowed in front of Allah as a piece into two of one soul.
    Little do you know what I carry for you, you would understand.
    I carry many responsibilities toward my parents, my brothers, my sisters and I embrace them with reverence. But love‚Ä¶ love is something different.
    It is not duty. It is not comfort. It is the silent willingness to disappear into someone else‚Äôs presence without fear. And in this world, among the people I have known, there are whom I would offer my life without question: my Sheikh my huzur, my Father my Abbu Jee‚Ä¶ and you.
    I speak to God of you daily.
    In my moments, I imagine you sitting beside me as a dopamine. I do not speak easily to others but to you in silence, I tell everything.
    I imagine a place beyond all impurity, where we speak as souls, not as strangers.
    No lifetime could ever be long enough to express this love. Even a thousand shared days could not reveal the quiet peace I imagine beside you.
    You may never know how much I love you.
    But know this you are always in my prayers.`;
